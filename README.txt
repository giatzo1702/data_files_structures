Data and files structures
=========================


Description:
-------------

This repository contains some of my old projects that implement several 
searching methods on the RAM and on the hard disk. The projects were created
for educational purposes, so I'm not responsible for any mistakes, bugs etc.


Contents:
----------

1. dfs_1 folder contains the source files for the following searching methods,
   applied on disk pages:
     
     binary searching, search using interpolation, searching using cache, 
     searching using indexes.

2. dfs_2 folder contains the source files for the implementation of B-tree on 
   RAM and on hard disk. Here there must be some little bugs.

3. dfs_3 folder contains the source files for dynamic hashing implementation
   using trie structure.


Programming Language:
----------------------

The projects were created in Java programming language so you have to import 
the files in a project to build and run them.

Good luck and have fun!
